# IROS_2018_Safe_Control

Supplementary code for the paper titled "Guaranteed Safe Semi-Autonomous Control of Hybrid Systems" by Nils Smit-Anseeuw, C. David Remy, and Ram Vasudevan submitted to Robotics and Automation Letters and IROS 2018. This code includes a script for running an interactive simulator of a compass gait walking model (runSimulator.m), as well as the scripts used in the paper for generating the dynamics of this model (calcEOM.m), and for taylor expanding these dynamics (taylorEOM.m).

## Getting Started

The three scripts in the main folder can each be run independently as desired.

### Prerequisites

The [spotless](https://github.com/spot-toolbox/spotless) toolbox.
